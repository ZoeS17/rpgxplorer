      <p>In a dungeon&rsquo;s damp, dark recesses, molds and fungi
thrive. While some plants and fungi are monsters and other slime, mold,
and fungus is just normal, innocuous stuff, a few varieties are
dangerous dungeon encounters. For purposes of spells and other special
effects, all slimes, molds, and fungi are treated as plants. Like
traps, dangerous slimes and molds have CRs, and characters earn XP for
encountering them.</p>
      <p>A form of glistening organic sludge coats almost anything that
remains in the damp and dark for too long. This kind of slime, though
it might be repulsive, is not dangerous.<br>
Molds and fungi flourish in dark, cool, damp places. While some are as
inoffensive as the normal dungeon slime, others are quite dangerous.
Mushrooms, puffballs, yeasts, mildew, and other sorts of bulbous,
fibrous, or flat patches of fungi can be found throughout most
dungeons. They are usually inoffensive, and some are even edible
(though most are unappealing or odd-tasting).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Green Slime (CR 4):</span>
This dungeon peril is a dangerous variety of normal slime. Green slime
devours flesh and organic materials on contact and is even capable of
dissolving metal. Bright green, wet, and sticky, it clings to walls,
floors, and ceilings in patches, reproducing as it consumes organic
matter. It drops from walls and ceilings when it detects movement (and
possible food) below.</p>
      <p>A single 5-foot square of green slime deals 1d6 points of
Constitution damage per round while it devours flesh. On the first
round of contact, the slime can be scraped off a creature (most likely
destroying the scraping device), but after that it must be frozen,
burned, or cut away (dealing damage to the victim as well). Anything
that deals cold or fire damage, sunlight, or a remove disease spell
destroys a patch of green slime. Against wood or metal, green slime
deals 2d6 points of damage per round, ignoring metal&rsquo;s hardness
but not that of wood. It does not harm stone.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yellow Mold (CR 6):</span> If
disturbed, a 5-foot square of this mold bursts forth with a cloud of
poisonous spores. All within 10 feet of the mold must make a DC 15
Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution damage. Another DC 15
Fortitude save is required 1 minute later-even by those who succeeded
on the first save-to avoid taking 2d6 points of Constitution damage.
Fire destroys yellow mold, and sunlight renders it dormant.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Brown Mold (CR 2):</span>
Brown mold feeds on warmth, drawing heat from anything around it. It
normally comes in patches 5 feet in diameter, and the temperature is
always cold in a 30-foot radius around it. Living creatures within 5
feet of it take 3d6 points of nonlethal cold damage. Fire brought
within 5 feet of brown mold causes it to instantly double in size. Cold
damage, such as from a cone of cold, instantly destroys it.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Phosphorescent Fungus (No CR):</span>
This strange underground fungus grows in clumps that look almost like
stunted shrubbery. Drow elves cultivate it for food and light. It gives
off a soft violet glow that illuminates underground caverns and
passages as well as a candle does. Rare patches of fungus illuminate as
well as a torch does.
